# Phase 3

The Integrated Practice phase gives learners a chance to synthesize and utilize skills developed in Foundations 1 & 2 through module-based assignments and small projects that mimic real world applications.

In Phase 3, you'll vote on a goal(from the list of goals below) using Echo, and will be put on a team. Most of the goals are pairing goals, with a couple solo goals mixed in.

## High Level Skills

In this phase you will learnâ€¦

- How to combine all of your `HTML and CSS`, `HTTP Server` and `Browser` skills together
- More JavaScript design patterns
- Full web application architecture
- How authentication works on most of the web
- Persisting web application state in a relational (SQL) database
- More advanced asynchronous patterns in JavaScript
- How to use Git and GitHub on a team
- How to render dynamically generated HTML
- How to add migrations to your database schema

## Recommended Roadmap

### Week 1

#### Goal: CRUD Mutability Goal(383)

#### Concepts to focus on
- Programming Naming Conventions
- Code Organization: splitting functions into their respective files, and folders
- Problem Decomposition: practice breaking each spec into smaller specs, so that it much easier to work on a smaller task at a time.
- RESTful Routes: Designing an API using RESTful routes, and using `method override` package to override the HTTP method of the request.
- Using the `fetch` API to make asynchronous HTTP requests from the browser. Make use of this [tutorial](https://davidwalsh.name/fetch).

### Week 2:

#### Goal: Authentication app(Goal 444)

#### Concepts to focus on
- Programming Naming Conventions

- Problem Decomposition: practice breaking each spec into smaller specs, so that it much easier to work on a smaller task at a time.
- Authentication: Adding authentication to an Express app using Postgres
- Security: Learning about encyption (using `bcrypt` module), and understanding why it is important to not store passwords in plain-text.
- Authorization: Adding roles to a user, such that access to a resource is restricted based on the role.
