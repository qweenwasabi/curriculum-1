# Your Portfolio Site - Goal 356

## Skills

## Challenge Rating

This goal will likely be within your ZPD if you...

- Can use Google to find relevant resources
- Are around your 30th week
- Have mostly completed at least 2 projects that would serve well as portfolio pieces

## Description

Create a good lookin' portfolio / resume site to help you get a job! Highlight your most impressive projects. To complete this goal, you'll need to have links to at least 2 live projects so part of your week might be spent cleaning up old projects and putting them on the internet.

Make your site simple! Make the content that employers will want to see front and center. Don’t make it hard to access important information. No excessive animations, especially if the animations are obscuring important content. No busy background images. When in doubt, take cues from other sites. Don’t invent metaphors: use metaphors that already exist and are widely used on the internet. Think clean, clean, clean.

## Specifications

- Site is hosted (I recommend Heroku or gh-pages)
- Site prominently features link to your GitHub
- Site uses a CSS framework
- Site includes blurb / screenshots / links (both to GitHub and live site) to one of your most impressive projects
- Site includes blurb / screenshots / links (both to GitHub and live site) to another of your most impressive projects
- Site includes blurbs / links to your open source contributions
- Site includes social links (like LinkedIn, Twitter, and other places to find you on the internet)
- Site includes an about page / section with a headshot
- Site includes an about page / section with a bio
- Your GitHub profile page is cleaned up with clear, descriptive READMEs for the projects you are highlighting

### Optional / Nice to have

- Site includes Twitter integration (tweets show up on site)
- Site includes a blog or a link to your blog
- Uses a custom domain (I recommend using [Google Domains](https://domains.google/)) - this will cost you a little $$
