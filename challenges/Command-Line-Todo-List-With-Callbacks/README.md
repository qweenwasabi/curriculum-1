# Command Line Todo List With Callbacks

This benchmark modules is the 2nd of a series of modules designed to take the
same problem and make it increasingly more complex as you learn new skills.

This module assumes you've already completed the
[Command Line Todo List](../../modules/Command-Line-Todo-List) module.

In this version we'll move from using synchronous code to using asynchronous
code.

## Skills

All the skills listed in the
[Command Line Todo List](../../modules/Command-Line-Todo-List/#skills)
module plus:

- Can use `fs.readFile` to read from a file in Node
- Can use `fs.writeFile` to write to a file in Node

## Description

See the description in the
[Command Line Todo List](../../modules/Command-Line-Todo-List/#description)
module.


## Specs

The specs for this module are the same as the specs listed in the
[Command Line Todo List](../../modules/Command-Line-Todo-List/#specs) module
except instead of `fs.readFileSync` and `fs.writeFileSync` you need to use
`fs.readFile` and `fs.writeFile` requiring you to use callbacks and async code
flow control.
